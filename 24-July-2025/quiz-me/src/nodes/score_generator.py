"""Score Generator Node for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements the score generator node that calculates scores, 
tracks progress, and provides comprehensive performance analytics.

Implementation will include:
- Overall score calculation
- Progress tracking across questions
- Performance analytics and insights
- Achievement and milestone tracking

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 04-node-implementations.md
