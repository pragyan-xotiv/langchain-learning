"""Topic Validator Node for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements the topic validator node that validates topic appropriateness 
and feasibility for quiz generation.

Implementation will include:
- Topic appropriateness assessment
- Content availability validation
- Difficulty level determination  
- Topic scope and boundary setting

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 04-node-implementations.md
