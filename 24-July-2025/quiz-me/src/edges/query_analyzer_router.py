"""Query Analyzer Router for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements routing logic after query analysis, determining the next
node based on the analyzed user intent and current application phase.

Implementation will include:
- Intent-based routing decisions
- Phase-aware routing logic
- Confidence-based fallback handling
- Error recovery routing

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 05-edge-logic.md

    Routes flow after query analysis based on user intent and current phase.
    
    This function determines the next node based on:
    - Analyzed user intent (start_quiz, answer_question, change_topic, etc.)
    - Current application phase (topic_selection, quiz_active, etc.)
    - Intent confidence levels and validation results
    - Error conditions from the analysis process
    
    Args:
        state: Current QuizState object with analysis results
        
    Returns:
        Name of the next node to execute
        
    Full implementation will include:
    - Intent-to-node mapping logic
    - Phase-aware routing decisions
    - Confidence threshold handling
    - Fallback routing for ambiguous inputs
