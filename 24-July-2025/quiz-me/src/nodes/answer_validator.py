"""Answer Validator Node for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements the answer validator node that evaluates user responses 
with intelligent scoring and provides detailed feedback.

Implementation will include:
- Multiple choice answer validation
- Open-ended response evaluation
- Partial credit scoring
- Detailed feedback generation

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 04-node-implementations.md
