"""Quiz Generator Node for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements the quiz generator node that creates diverse, engaging 
quiz questions based on the validated topic.

Implementation will include:
- Multiple question type generation (multiple choice, open-ended, true/false)
- Difficulty level management
- Question diversity and uniqueness
- Answer key generation

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 04-node-implementations.md
