"""Score Generator Router for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements routing logic after score generation, determining the next
node based on quiz completion status and user progression.

Implementation will include:
- Quiz completion vs continuation routing
- Final score presentation routing
- Next question generation routing
- Session management routing

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 05-edge-logic.md
