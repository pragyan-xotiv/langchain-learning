# Application Flow

## Overview

The Interactive Quiz Generator provides a seamless, conversational experience that guides users through the entire quiz journey. This document describes the complete user experience and system behavior from initial interaction to completion.

## Complete User Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Engagement

**User Experience:**
1. User starts the application
2. System presents welcome message and asks for quiz topic
3. User can type any topic (e.g., "I want a quiz about Python programming")

**System Behavior:**
- Application initializes with empty state
- Query Analyzer processes initial input
- Conversation history begins tracking
- System prepares for topic processing

**Example Interaction:**
```
System: "Welcome to the Interactive Quiz Generator! What topic would you like to be quizzed on?"
User: "I'd like a quiz about marine biology"
```

---

### Phase 2: Topic Validation and Setup

**User Experience:**
1. System acknowledges the topic request
2. Performs validation (usually transparent to user)
3. Either confirms topic and begins quiz, or asks for clarification

**System Behavior:**
- Query Analyzer classifies intent as "start_quiz"
- Topic Validator extracts and validates "marine biology"
- Checks topic appropriateness, specificity, and feasibility
- Updates state with validated topic information
- Prepares quiz metadata (difficulty, estimated questions, etc.)

**Successful Path:**
```
System: "Great! I'll create a marine biology quiz for you. Let's start with 10 questions covering various aspects of marine life. Here's your first question..."
```

**Validation Failure Path:**
```
System: "I'm having trouble creating questions about that topic. Could you try a more specific subject? For example, instead of 'everything,' you could ask about 'World War II history' or 'basic algebra.'"
```

---

### Phase 3: Active Quiz Experience

**User Experience:**
1. System presents first question
2. User provides answer in natural language
3. System evaluates answer and provides immediate feedback
4. Process repeats for subsequent questions
5. User can exit or start new quiz at any time

**System Behavior:**
- Quiz Generator creates contextually appropriate questions
- Questions vary in type (multiple choice, open-ended, true/false)
- Answer Validator evaluates responses using intelligent matching
- Score Generator tracks progress and calculates running totals
- System maintains conversation flow and context

**Question Presentation Examples:**

**Multiple Choice:**
```
System: "Question 1: Which of the following is the largest whale species?
A) Blue whale
B) Humpback whale  
C) Sperm whale
D) Gray whale"

User: "A"

System: "Correct! The blue whale is indeed the largest animal ever known to have lived on Earth, reaching lengths up to 100 feet. 
Score: 10/10 (1 of 10 questions complete)"
```

**Open-Ended:**
```
System: "Question 2: Explain the difference between fish and marine mammals."

User: "Fish breathe through gills and are cold-blooded, while marine mammals like whales breathe air through lungs and are warm-blooded"

System: "Excellent answer! You correctly identified the key differences: breathing mechanisms and temperature regulation. Marine mammals also give birth to live young and nurse them with milk.
Score: 25/20 (2 of 10 questions complete)"
```

### Phase 4: Dynamic User Control

**User Experience:**
At any point during the quiz, users can:
- Answer the current question
- Type "start new quiz" to change topics
- Type "exit" to end the session
- Ask for clarification or help

**System Behavior:**
- Query Analyzer continuously monitors for intent changes
- System gracefully handles topic switches mid-quiz
- State management preserves or resets data as appropriate
- Provides helpful responses to unclear inputs

**Mid-Quiz Topic Change:**
```
[During question 5 of 10]
User: "Actually, I want to start a new quiz about astronomy"

System: "No problem! I'll start a fresh astronomy quiz for you. Your marine biology quiz scored 40/50 on the first 4 questions - not bad! 

Now, what aspect of astronomy interests you most? General space facts, planets, stars, or something specific?"
```

**Clarification Request:**
```
User: "I don't understand this question"

System: "Let me rephrase that question: We're asking about the process by which coral reefs are formed. Think about how coral polyps create the structure we see as coral reefs. What biological and chemical processes are involved?"
```

---

### Phase 5: Progress Tracking and Feedback

**User Experience:**
1. Continuous score updates after each question
2. Encouraging feedback and explanations
3. Progress indicators for finite quizzes
4. Performance insights and learning opportunities

**System Behavior:**

## Special Flow Scenarios

### Infinite Quiz Mode

**User Experience:**
- Quiz continues indefinitely until user chooses to stop
- Questions become progressively more challenging
- User can end at any natural stopping point

**System Behavior:**
- No predetermined question limit
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on performance
- Periodic check-ins to see if user wants to continue

**Example:**
```
[After 15 questions]
System: "You're on a roll! We've covered 15 questions and you're maintaining an 80% accuracy rate. 

Would you like to continue with more challenging questions, or would you prefer to wrap up here? I can keep going as long as you'd like!"
```

### Error Recovery Scenarios

**Connection Issues:**
```
System: "I'm having trouble generating the next question. Let me try a different approach... 

[Fallback question from cache]

If you continue to see issues, you can type 'exit' and try again later."
```

**Unclear User Input:**
```
User: "uhhh maybe kinda sorta"

System: "I'm not sure how to interpret that response. For this true/false question about whale migration, please answer either:
- True (or yes, correct, T)  
- False (or no, incorrect, F)

Or if you'd like to skip this question, just say 'skip' or 'next question.'"
```
