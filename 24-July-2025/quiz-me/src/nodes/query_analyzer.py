"""Query Analyzer Node for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements the query analyzer node that analyzes user input to determine 
intent and context. This is typically the first node in the workflow that processes
user messages.

Implementation will include:
- LLM-powered intent classification
- Context-aware analysis
- Conversation history integration
- Error recovery mechanisms

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 04-node-implementations.md

    Analyzes user input to determine intent and context.
    
    This node processes user input to understand:
    - User intent (start_quiz, answer_question, change_topic, exit, etc.)
    - Extracted entities and context
    - Conversation flow requirements
    - Error conditions that need handling

        state: Current QuizState object containing user input and context

        Updated state with analysis results
        
    Raises:
        QueryAnalyzerError: If analysis fails or input is invalid
        
    Full implementation will include:
    - LLM-powered intent classification using structured prompts
    - Context extraction from conversation history
    - Confidence scoring for intent predictions
    - Fallback handling for ambiguous inputs
