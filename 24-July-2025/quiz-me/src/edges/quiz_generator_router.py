"""Quiz Generator Router for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements routing logic after quiz generation, determining the next
node based on question generation success and quiz progression status.

Implementation will include:
- Question generation success/failure routing
- Quiz progression management
- Question presentation routing
- Error recovery for generation failures

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 05-edge-logic.md

    Routes flow after question generation based on generation success and quiz status.
    
    This function determines the next node based on:
    - Question generation success/failure status
    - Current quiz progression (first question, continuing, etc.)
    - Question availability and queue management
    - Error conditions during generation
    
    Args:
        state: Current QuizState object with generation results
        
    Returns:
        Name of the next node to execute
        
    Full implementation will include:
    - Generation success routing (present question to user)
    - Generation failure recovery (retry or fallback)
    - Quiz progression management
    - Question queue and availability checking
    - Error handling and recovery routing
