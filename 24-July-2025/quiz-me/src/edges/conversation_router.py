"""Main Conversation Router for the Interactive Quiz Generator

This module implements the primary routing function that determines which node 
to execute next based on the current state. This is the main decision point 
in the workflow.

Implementation will include:
- Primary routing logic based on current phase
- User intent-based routing decisions
- Error condition handling and recovery
- State validation before routing

To be implemented in Phase 2 following 05-edge-logic.md

    Primary routing function that determines next node based on state.
    
    This is the main decision point that routes flow based on:
    - Current phase (topic_selection, topic_validation, quiz_active, etc.)
    - User intent (start_quiz, answer_question, change_topic, exit, etc.)
    - Validation results and success/failure conditions
    - Error conditions that require special handling
    - Quiz completion status
    
    Args:
        state: Current QuizState object containing phase, intent, and context
        
    Returns:
        Name of the next node to execute
        
    Full implementation will include:
    - Comprehensive state analysis and validation
    - Intent-based routing with fallback logic
    - Error condition detection and recovery routing
    - State transition validation and logging
